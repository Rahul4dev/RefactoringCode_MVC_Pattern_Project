# RefactoringCode_MVC_Pattern_Project
Project based on blogging and commenting on author's work, it applies maintainability  of code through refactoring and MVC pattern for the same.

## Why refactoring of code is adviced??
  
  - Basically, by refactoring, we give the website code a standardized and organized look. Coders generally take fear from refactoring the code because, before refactoring, their code runs, nobody is complaining about the code maintainability because coder has to maintain it by thier own, just like we maintain our Room, where we live alone.
  
  - Refactoring process require pure conceptual clarity of the code and the fuction it does on that file. In refactoring process, we just move those files from bulky file to multiple short files which get organised in multiple folders. We have to then import/ export those files to app or main file from where our code runs.
  
  - We had also refactored the html and CSS files before, the same reason is applicable here as, the maintainability and easy bug-fixing compatibility comes with the organised codes. If code remain haywire, that coder who himself wrote that code months ago, will take days to understand the code functionalities. After refactoring, both coder and new coders, who do not know much about that code, can even usnderstand the code and fix the bug.
