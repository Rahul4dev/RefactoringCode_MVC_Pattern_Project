# RefactoringCode_MVC_Pattern_Project
Project based on blogging and commenting on author's work, it applies maintainability  of code through refactoring and MVC pattern for the same.

## Why refactoring of code is adviced??
  - Improving or updating the code without changing the software’s functionality or external behavior of the application is known as code refactoring.
  
  - Basically, by refactoring, we give the website code a standardized and organized look. Coders generally take fear from refactoring the code because, before refactoring, their code runs, nobody is complaining about the code maintainability because coder has to maintain it by thier own, just like we maintain our Room, where we live alone.
  
  - Refactoring process require pure conceptual clarity of the code and the fuction it does on that file. In refactoring process, we just move those files from bulky file to multiple short files which get organised in multiple folders. We have to then import/ export those files to app or main file from where our code runs.
  
  - We had also refactored the html and CSS files before, the same reason is applicable here as, the maintainability and easy bug-fixing compatibility comes with the organised codes. If code remain haywire, that coder who himself wrote that code months ago, will take days to understand the code functionalities. After refactoring, both coder and new coders, who do not know much about that code, can even usnderstand the code and fix the bug.

  - According to GFG, refactoring helps when you might have written some duplicate code without looking at the existing code or you may have written some longer methods/functions, large classes, too many parameters, non-intuitive variable names, code placement, etc. 
  
  - Refctoring reduces the technical cost and makes the code more efficient and maintainable. If you don’t pay attention to the code refactoring process earlier, you will pay for errors in your code later. So don’t ignore cleaning up the code.
